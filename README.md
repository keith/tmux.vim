# **DEPRECATED**

This repo has been deprecated for [this
replacement](https://github.com/ericpruitt/tmux.vim). It also ships with
vim by default so you should already have it.

# tmux.vim

This is syntax highlighting for tmux. This is pulled directly from the
sample file installed by default with tmux on OS X via Homebrew.

If you don't have a preferred installation method check out
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

## Usage

This automatically detects all .tmux.conf\* and tmux.conf\* files as
tmux configuration files.
